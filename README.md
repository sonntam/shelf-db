Shelf-DB
========

WIP Notice
----------

This project is still in an early development stage and not yet ready for production
environments. Because of that there are no setup instructions present yet.

Introduction
------------

Shelf-DB is a web application based on php/MySQL/Javascript to keep track of things.
The design is mobile-first.

It is formally based on Part-DB https://github.com/sandboxgangster/Part-DB but
now completely rewritten from scratch, offering new features and a different
UI approach.
